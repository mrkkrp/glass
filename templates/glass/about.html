<p>
  This is minimalistic forum written in Python using Django web
  framework. By the time you read this, it should be fully operational. By
  the way, you can <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/glass">fork it on
    GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
  Here is list of features that should help you understand what is this
  about.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Users can register on the site.</p></li>
    <li><p>Once registered, user can create tagged topics.</p></li>
    <li><p>Other users can filter all existing topics by tag and possibly by
        other criteria; this way they can find a topic of interest.</p></li>
    <li><p>Every topic has introducing post. Just like any other post, it
        can be upvoted. Upvoting is reversible, but a post cannot be
        downvoted. Its rating can be used to order topics, etc.</p></li>
    <li><p>Although every post can be &ldquo;upvoted&rdquo;, there is no
        such thing as karma (sum of all upvotes from all posts by particular
        user) that would grant additional privileges to users. This way we
        avoid inequality on the site, while users still can see what others
        deem important or otherwise noticeable.</p></li>
    <li><p>Users can post in any topic of course. Standard markdown is
        used. User can only edit or delete his/her post when it's the latest
        post in thread.</p></li>
    <li><p>There is notion of user profile, which is useful if you want to
        edit your own profile but is currently quite boring if you want to
        take a look at other people's profiles. Although you can see their
        recent postings.</p></li>
    <li><p>Many other little goodish things like decent pagification, links
        per post, etc., start development server and see for
        yourself.</p></li>
  </ul>
